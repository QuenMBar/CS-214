1) 	The lex.yy.c file sets up a switch to see if the inputed command is one of the 
	ones from the .lex file.  If it is, it outputs the apropriate response and if 
	it isnt, it outputs what was entered.  

2) 	It recognizes a word or a number by what the starting value is.  If it is a 
	number or a word.  It doesnt matter except for if it is a number first, then it 
	will log if it becomes a word.  Also, spaces, dashes, and underscores reset the 
	parser and lets it find more words and numbers.

3) 	A terminal is a print statement because there is no other actions to be taken 
	after it is printed.  Once the print statements are executed, it waits for a 
	command.  The commands are the non termianls because they need to cue actions by 
	the program.

4)	The only strange thing i saw was it would crash if any numbers were entered.
